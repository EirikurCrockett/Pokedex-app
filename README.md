# Pokedex app
 
This is an app that is currently a work in progress. 
The primary repo for this app is currently private, and this copy has slight differences for security. 
I will update this repo as progress is made on the offical version of the app.

This app uses Next.js for front and backend; Prisma for ORM, and PostgreSQL for it's database
